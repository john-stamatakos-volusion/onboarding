    $ npm install vbox

## Development

1. Check out this repo

2. Make your changes locally

3. Commit your changes (but don't push yet)

4. In your terminal, cd into the vbox folder and run the following command where patch, minor, or major is the update type. Note the new version number.

    `$ npm version patch|minor|major`


5. Merge/push your changes to the master branch on github

6. On github, go to "releases" and create a new release tagged "vx.x.x" with the version number from step 3 (title and description don't matter)

7. To get the latest changes in your application, go into your application and update the version number in the package.json file

_Note:_ As you develop locally, it may be helpful to point your package.json to a local copy of vbox with this:

    "vbox": "file:/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/vbox",
